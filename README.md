# scraper

This app is supposed to scrape articles and allow users to save those articles, add/delete notes and remove the articles.

I psuedocoded the routes as i believe they should work and in the app.js file wrote out all the functions i believe would be necessary for the app to run as expected. 

This app's only functionality is scraping articles and displaying the titles and links with handlebars.. 

This app was a giant fail but i am taking it as a learning experience and will come back and try to figure out where i was getting off track or if i was close without realizing it.
